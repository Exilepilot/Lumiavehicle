Lumiavehicle
=================
Vehicle system for Lumia. An MTA server. 

Features:
- Allows users to buy and (eventually) sell their cars. 
- Users can buy multiple cars. Spawn them, destroy them and sell. 
- The car will be spawned with it's previous damage. Giving realism. 
- Designed to be more intuitive than the community scripts out there.

----
*Bugs*

- When a player is buying cars, they'll show up in the car list for every other player. Allowing them to spawn it, and use it as their own. (currently fixing)

If you're lurking through repositiories and find any errors which may cause a bug(s). Then please submit an issue. :-)
